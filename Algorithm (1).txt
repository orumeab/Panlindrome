ALGORITHM
1. First, you'll have to split the string into words which splits the string at white space characters
2. Then, you convert each word to an array using 'toCharArray()'
3. Then, check if each word is a palindrome using the "isPalindrome" method which checks if a word is a palindrome by comparing characters frim both sides of the string
4. Store the character arrays and palindrome results for easy manipulation.
5. Print the character arrays and palindrome check results
